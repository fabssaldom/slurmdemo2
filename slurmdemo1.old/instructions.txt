Advanced Deployment Instructions
================================

Terraform group 'networkstorage' was successfully created in directory slurmdemo1/networkstorage
To deploy, run the following commands:

terraform -chdir=slurmdemo1/networkstorage init
terraform -chdir=slurmdemo1/networkstorage validate
terraform -chdir=slurmdemo1/networkstorage apply
gcluster export-outputs slurmdemo1/networkstorage

Terraform group 'slurm-cluster' was successfully created in directory slurmdemo1/slurm-cluster
To deploy, run the following commands:

gcluster import-inputs slurmdemo1/slurm-cluster
terraform -chdir=slurmdemo1/slurm-cluster init
terraform -chdir=slurmdemo1/slurm-cluster validate
terraform -chdir=slurmdemo1/slurm-cluster apply

Destroying infrastructure when no longer needed
===============================================

Automated
---------

gcluster destroy slurmdemo1

Advanced / Manual
